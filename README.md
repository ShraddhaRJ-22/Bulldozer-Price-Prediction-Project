# Bulldozer-Price-Prediction-Project
This project predicts the resale prices of bulldozers using historical auction data. It applies regression algorithms to estimate pricing trends based on factors like equipment type, usage, age, and economic conditions.

## Key Features:

Preprocessed and cleaned a large dataset with missing and categorical values.
Implemented machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost.
Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Visualized price trends and feature correlations to enhance interpretability.

## Technologies Used:
  - Python
  - Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - 
## Purpose:
To aid stakeholders in making data-driven decisions regarding equipment pricing and auction strategies.
